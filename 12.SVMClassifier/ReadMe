   the UCI repository, 
   https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29
   
2. Tabulate and visualize the distribution of the numeric variables.

3. Perform the required preprocessing , 70,30 split and build a classifier using the 
   SVM model available in SciKit Learn.

4. Tune the hyperparameters of kernel (linear, polynomial, and radial basis), 
   regularization and gamma. Tabulate the model performance and comment on 
   the best model found for the given dataset.
