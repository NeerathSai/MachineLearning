Download fuel consumption dataset "FuelConsumption.csv", which contains modelspecific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions. 

• Select the features 'ENGINESIZE', 'CYLINDERS', 
  'FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB', 'CO2EMISSIONS' to use for building the 
   model. Plot Emission values with respect to Engine size.

• split the data into training and test sets (70:30) to create a model using training 
  set, evaluate the model using test set, and use model to predict unknown value.

• Try to use a polynomial regression with the dataset of degree – 3, 4 & 5. Verify 
  the accuracy by calculating Mean absolute error, Residual sum of squares, R2-
  score and comment on which model is the best.
