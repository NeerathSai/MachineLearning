1. Write down the meta information about the “wine.csv” data file available in the 
   UCI repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine.

2. Tabulate and visualize the distribution of the numeric variables.

3. Perform the required preprocessing , 70,30 split and build a classifier using the 
   Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier model available in SciKit Learn. Use 3 layers 
   with the same number of neurons as there are features along with 500 max iterations.
   
4. Tabulate the precision, recall and F1-score.

5. Display the MLP weights and biases after training your model.
