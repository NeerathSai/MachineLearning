Consider the 'HousePrice.csv' dataset which describes the features and sale price of a 
house. Build a regression model using regularization to predict the value of the 
properties.

1. Perform the preprocessing if required, scale the train and test data using standard 
   scaler.

2. Split the dataset into train size of 70% and test size of 30% and Apply the Ridge 
   and Lasso regression and fit the model containing all independent variables.

3. Make predictions on test data “HousePriceTest.csv” and tabulate performance of 
   both models on unseen data.
