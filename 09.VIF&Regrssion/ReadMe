Consider the dataset 'weatherAUS' called Rain in Australia. It describes the weather 
characteristics on different dates and locations. This dataset contains about 10 years of 
daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.

1. Preprocess the data, remove the attributes which were are not useful to predict 
   rain. Also, remove rows with at least one missing value for each of them. 

2. Calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) value. VIF is a number that 
   determines whether a variable has multicollinearity or not (starts from 1, and it 
   has no upper limit. If the number gets larger, it means the variable has huge 
   multicollinearity on it.). 

3. Remove multicollinearities by creating new features. Find the features that have 
   paired values and create the new feature which is the difference value between 
   those pairs.

4. Remove features that have a VIF value above 5.

5. Build a regression model to perform the Rain prediction. Also, tabulate accuracy 
   of the prediction models, before and VIF computation.
