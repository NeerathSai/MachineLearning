1. For the IRIS data set write down the meta information.

2. Visualize the class label against the predictor variable using appropriate plots.

3. Use the IRIS data set to build a logistic regression model (using sklearn) and predict the class label 
   ‘Species’. Divide the dataset into training and test set (70,30) using train_test_split method in sklearn. 

4. Analysis and visualize the performance of the classifier using metrics, confusion matrix .

5. Use the IRIS data and KNeighborsClassifier (using sklearn) and predict the class label ‘Species’ for 
   k value between 2 and 20. Divide the dataset into training and test set (70,30) using train_test_split 
   method in sklearn.

6. Identify the best k ( for k between 2 and 20) for the model built.

7. Comment on the classifier (Logistic Regression or KNeighborsClassifier ) that has a better 
   performance for the IRIS dataset
