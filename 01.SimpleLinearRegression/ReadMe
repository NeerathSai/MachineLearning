1. Write a user defined function ‘myFnLinReg(x,y)’ to perform Simple Linear 
   Regression given one predictor attribute and one response attribute. The 
   function should return the coefficients of the straight line.

2. Use mtcars data set and consider the attributes mpg and weight. Split data into 
   train and test sets (80 %,20%). Put training data set to ‘myFnLinReg(x,y)’ to 
   build a linear regression model to predict mpg given the weight of the car.

3. What is the mpg of a car, whose weight is 5.5?

4. Compute and print accuracy measures such as RMSE and R2 for the test set. 

5. Apply the stochastic gradient descent and mini batch gradient descent 
   algorithms to enhance the accuracy and visualize the cost function.
