1. Use the titanic data set, perform preprocessing by deal with missing values, drop 
   irrelevant attributes.

2. Use the scikit learn pipelines to perform the preprocessing - standardizing, 
   encoding and model fitting in one step. 

3. Perform Bayes classification using cross validation.

4. Tabulate using relevant measures of accuracy , Sensitivity and specificity.

5. Visualize the ROC curve and comment on performance
