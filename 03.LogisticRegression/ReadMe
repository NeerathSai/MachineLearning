1. Use the “pima-indians-diabetes.csv” dataset and note down the meta information.

2. Compute mean & standard deviation , tabulate and visualize the age of the patients.

3. Analyze and tabulate the relationship of age, BMI of patients with respect to the class.

4. Tabulate the class label and comment on whether the classes are balanced.

5. Use the data set to build a logistic regression model (using sklearn) and predict the class label. Divide 
   the dataset into training and test set (70,30) using train_test_split method in sklearn. 

6. Use the test data set and evaluate the performance using a confusion matrix. Visualize the confusion 
   matrix using a heat map.

7. Compute accuracy rate, true positive and true negative rate and comment on the performance.

8. Visualize the ROC curve, and comment on the performance of the classifier.
